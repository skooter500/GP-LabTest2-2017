# Game Programming Lab Test 2 2017

## Rules of the test

- This is an open book test. You can use any of your own sketches, any of the examples from the course website or the Processing reference during the test.
- No conferring or collaboration.
- No use of Google, Facebook, Slack or any any other web resources permitted.
- I suggest you commit your sketch to a git repository or otherwise back up your work during the test!
- zip up your project and subit the zip file to webcourses when you are finished. 
- Make sure your zip file is named like D111111_Bryan_Duggan.zip (replace with your student number and name)

Here is a video of the sketch you will be making today:

Start by making a new Processing project and save it with the following name D111111_Bryan_Duggan (replace with your student number and name).

What is happening:

The screen is divided into the land and the sky. When mouse is clicked over the sky a bird is spawned. The birds will randomly choose whether to move left to right or right to left and should be drawn as per the video using two circles. The user can click several times to add birds. When a bird moves past the bounds of screen it should no longer be drawn.

Clicking on the land spawns a tree. The height of each tree varies randomly between 50 and 100 pixels and as you can see, the tree should grow to that height when it is spawned and then stop growing. Each tree has a random number of between 3 and 8 leaves (not including the center leaf). The colour of the leaves is random.

Marking scheme:

| Description | Marks |
|-------------|-------|
| Implementing the birds | 20 |
| Implementing the Trees | 30 |
| Use of an ArrayList | 15 |
| Polymorphism | 15 |
| Polish and flair | 20 |

If you cant figure out how to do a part of the test, you should move on and do other parts. You should try to use classes, inheritance and polymorphism in your solution, but its not essential. You can add one two additional cool things to get the marks for polish and flair. Just come up with some ideas of your own. 

At the end of the test, zip up your sketch folder making sure it is named correctly and submit it to webcourses. If you made a git repository for your test submission, submit the link to it also.
